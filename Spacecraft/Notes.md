# Software Development Process

## [Waterfall Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

### A Sequential design approach of engineering design

In Royce's original waterfall model, there are these 6 following phases:

* System and software requirements
* Analysis
* Design
* Coding
* Testing
* Operations

Where requirements are outline in product requirements documents. They are then analysed to produce models, schema and business rules. These would form a framework for the software architecture. The coding phase is where development and integration happens. Finally, testing and operations go hand in hand, with the debugging of defects and the maintenance, installation of completed systems.

## [Scrum Methodology](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum)

### An agile way to manage software development

Scrum leaves it up to the development team to figure how best to proceed and solve the problems they are presented. It is based on desired outcome and timeboxes called sprints. The whole team is engaged in the organization of tasks and task assignments. Artifacts generated from Scrum development are the product itself, the product backlog - functionalties to be added to the product and burndown charts.

## [Software Development Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)

### Ways to divide software development into phases

Sticking to a process aims to improve design, product management and project management. Many methodologies rely on having their own definition of deliverables and artifacts that are to be created by the team using the process.

Most modern processes are "agile" and other methodologies are waterfall (linear framework), prototyping (iterative framework), iterative and incremental development (combined linear-iterative framework), spiral development (idem), rapid application development (iterative framework), and extreme programming.

## [Best Coding Practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_coding_practices)

### Set of informal rules to improve quality of software

#### Ninety-ninety rule

Tom Cargill says: "THe first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time."

#### Guidance

To prevent exceeding timetables, we stick to informal rules that allow to improve software.

#### Software Quality

A software can be generalised into these attributes to qualify its quality (according to Sommerville):
* Maintainability
* Dependability
* Efficiency
* Usability


Weinberg has these four targets when it comes to good programming:
* Does a program meet its specifications
* Is the program produced on schedule (and within budget)?
* How daptable is the program to cope with changing requirements?
* Is the program efficient enough for the environment in which it is used?

Hoare has these seventeen objectives to meet for good programs:
* Clear definition of purpose
* Simplicity of use
* Ruggedness
* Early availability
* Reliability
* Extensibility in the light of experience
* Brevity
* Efficiency
* Minimum cost to develop
* Conformity to any relevant standards
* Clear, accurate, and precise user documents
