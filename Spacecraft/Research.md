# CubeSat Research

Spacecraft design and development is full of challenges that are unique to space. In order to forecast procedures in case of failures, it is necessary to adopt a rigorous structure for software development. Radiation, for example, can cause bit flips, one of the many single failure events that can happen in space.

## Need a rigorous software development methodology

In order to ensure verifiability and correctness of the software, it is crucial to use one of the time-tested methodologies of software development. Those are centered into deliverables which are essentially different parts of the final product which have been broken down. Many of the more modern methodologies are considered "agile", but there exists many others such as: Waterfall, Prototyping, Iterative and Incremental Development, Spiral Development, Rapid Application Development and Extreme Programming.
